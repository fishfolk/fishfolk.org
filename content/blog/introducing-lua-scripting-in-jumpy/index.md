Modding has been a big priority for us with [Jumpy], and today we hit a big milestone:
we successfully implemented an in-game item with the Lua scripting language! After tons
of preparation and a migration to our new [Bones] framework, we were finally able to prove
out the scriptability of our custom Entity Component System ( ECS ), and the functionality
of the new [Piccolo] Lua VM.

[Piccolo] is a Lua VM written Rust by [@kyren]. Deveopment on it was recently picked back
up and Jumpy is one of it's first new users. Since it's written in Rust, Piccolo makes it
possible for us to embed Lua scripting even in the web builds of our game. Being that lua is
simple and already a popular language for game modding, it works great to have a pure Rust
implementation for Jumpy!

The Bones Framework scripting system gives Lua code the ability to access the assets, resources,
entities, and components in the ECS in a way that is reminiscent of the Rust API. Our new runtime
reflection system, [`bones_schema`], allows both Lua and Rust code to access any `#[repr(C)]` data
types directly, giving great power Lua scripts, without a lot of manual effort writing bindings.
This should really expand on the ability of Jumpy mods to do things that we haven't even thought
about yet, because it's got almost as much access to the world as Rust does.

As a proof-of-concept, we used this new power to create an anchor item for Jumpy. All of the
item-specific code is implemented in Lua and YAML files which can be hot-reloaded while the game
is running! You can see all the new anchor assets [here][anchor_assets], and for the curious, below
you will find the full lua code for the anchor item, with extra comments explaining different pieces.

We literally _just_ got this working, so there are limitations here and there that still need
fixing, but the major challenges appear to have been overcome, and we're not goint to stop
there! We've established the foundation for proper asset packs, and soon we hope to have a way
to easily install user mods into the game.

Scripted items are big accomplishment, but we've still got way further to go. I'm excited to continue
the journey! ðŸš€

    -- Since anchor_meta is a SchemaBox, we don't know what it's inner type is, so we check
    -- to see if it's schema matches the AnchorMeta schema. This tells us that the map element

-- Finally, we must register the two systems that we created to add them to their
