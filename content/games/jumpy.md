## Overview

Fish Folk: Jumpy is a tactical 2D shooter, played by up to 4 players online or on a shared screen. Aim either left or right; the rest is up to clever movement and positioning in this fish-on-fish brawler! For more information about our origin story (Duck Game et.al.) and big-picture plans, see our [design document](https://www.notion.so/erlendsh/Fish-Fight-1647ed74217e4e38a59bd28f4f5bc81a).

## Web Demo

Jumpy runs in the browser! You can play [web demo][web_demo] to try out the game, without needing to install anything on your computer.

We recommend using the Chrome browser or other derivatives for the best performance, or if you have issues with other browsers.
